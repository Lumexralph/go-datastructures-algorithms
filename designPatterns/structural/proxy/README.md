# Proxy

It is a structural pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder object for another object.
A proxy controls access to the original object, it allows you to perform something either before or after request gets to the original object.

A proxy receives client requests, does some work or added functionality (access control, authorization, authentication, caching, firewall, lazy loading, logging, etc.) and then passes the request to a service object.

A proxy object is referred to as wrapper, surrogate or handle. It is applied in remote, virtual, smart or protection proxies.
