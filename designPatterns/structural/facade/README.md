# Facade

It is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, framework or set of classes.
Use Facade when you want to have a limited and straight forward interface to a complex subsystem

Facade is an entry point to different subsystems, and it simplifies the dependencies between the systems. The facade pattern provides an interface that hides the implementation details of the hidden code.
