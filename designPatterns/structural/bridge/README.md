# Bridge

 Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies — abstraction and implementation which can be developed independently of each other.

Abstraction (also called interface) is a high-level control layer for some entity. This layer isn’t supposed to do any real work on its own. It should delegate the work to the implementation layer (also called platform).

Bridge is a structural design pattern that divides business logic or huge class into separate class hierarchies that can be developed independently - [refactor guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/bridge/)
