# Decorator

Decorator is a structural pattern that let's you add new behaviours to objects by placing these objects into special wrapper objects that contain the new behaviours.

Use this pattern when you want to be able to assign extra behaviour to objects at runtime without breaking the existing code.
You can also use this pattern when it is awkward or not possible to extend an object's behaviour using inheritance.

The decorator pattern helps with modifying existing instance attributes and adding new methods at run-time.”
