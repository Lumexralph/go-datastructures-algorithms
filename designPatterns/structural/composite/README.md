# Composite

A composite is a group of similar objects in a single object.
It is a design pattern that let's you compose objects into tree structure and then work with these tree strctures as if they are individual objects.
Composite became a pretty popular solution for the most problems that require building a tree structure.

You can use the composite pattern, for example, for UI layouts on the web, for directory trees(file system), and for managing employees across departments. The pattern provides a mechanism to access the individual objects and groups in a similar manner.
