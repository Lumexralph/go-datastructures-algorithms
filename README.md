# Go Data Structures, Algorithms and Design Patterns

In the quest to continue learning, build better softwares with efficient algorithms with thought of algorithm complexity and also deepening my understanding of Go language.

This project will be about creating data structures, algorithms and also some design patterns while studying a book on data structures and algorithm in Go by Bhagvan Kommadi.


## Data Structures

A data structure is the organization of data to reduce the storage space and to reduce difficulty while performing different tasks on the data.

## Topic and Concepts Covered

- Classification of data structures

- Structural design patterns

- Representation of algorithms
Complexity and performance analysis

- Brute force algorithms

- Divide and conquer algorithms

- Backtracking algorithms
