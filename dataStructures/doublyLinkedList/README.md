# Doubly Linked List

In a doubly linked list, all nodes have a pointer to the node they are connected to, on either side of them, in the list. This means that each node is connected to two nodes, and we can traverse forward through to the next node or backward through to the previous node. Doubly linked lists allow insertion, deletion and, obviously, traversing operations‚Äù
