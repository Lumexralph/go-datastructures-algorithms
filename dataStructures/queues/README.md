# Queue

A queue consists of elements to be processed in a particular order or based on priority.

It has operations such as enqueue, dequeue and peek.
Queues are commonly used for storing tasks that need to be done, or incoming HTTP requests that need to be processed by a server. In real life, handling interruptions in real-time systems, call handling, and CPU task scheduling are good examples for using queues.”
