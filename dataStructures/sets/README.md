# Sets

A Set is an unordered linear data structure that has a collection of values that are not repeated.
“A set can store unique values without any particular order. In the real world, sets can be used to collect all tags for blog posts and conversation participants in a chat. The data can be of Boolean, integer, float, characters, and other types. Static sets allow only query operations, which means operations related to querying the elements. Dynamic and mutable sets allow for the insertion and deletion of elements. Algebraic operations such as union, intersection, difference, and subset can be defined on the sets”
