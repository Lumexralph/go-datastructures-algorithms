# Linked List

Linked List is a sequence of nodes that have properties and a reference to the next node in the sequence.
It is a linear data structure that is used to store data. The data structure permits the addition and deletion of components from any node next to another node. They are notÂ stored contiguously in memory, which makes them different arrays.
