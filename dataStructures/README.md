# Data Structures

Data Structure refers to the organization of data in a computer's memory, in order to retrieve it quickly for processing.

A data structure is chosen based on the problem type and the operations performed on the data.

## Types of Data Structures

### Lists

A list is a sequence of elements. Each element can be connected to another with a link in a forward or backward direction.


### Tuples

A tuple is a finite sorted list of elements. It is a data structure that groups data. Tuples are typically immutable sequential collections. A database record is referred to as tuple.
